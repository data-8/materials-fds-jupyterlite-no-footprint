JupyterLite Specific Notes and Instructions:
- File changes in repository but not when loaded in JL:
Cached files can be problem if you are loading a previously rendered notebook with changes into the same browser. If this happens, "Clear Site Data" from the browser preferences menu.
- Finding the correct notebook:
-- The "lec" folder contains all the lecture notebooks from Data 8. 
-- The "data8-notebooks" folder contains all the homework, lab, and project notebooks. They are organized by homework, lab, or project number. For example, if you are looking for the lab 1 notebook, you would open : data8-notebooks/lab/lab01/lab01.ipynb
